This is the structure of the code.

Disk: UnixFile
   |
Disk space manager: DiskSpaceMgr, PageId, Page
   |
Buffer manager: BufferMgr, Frame

1. Disk
   All data are stored in one file. 
   The file is implemented in class UnixFile.

2. Disk space manager
   The data to the UnixFile is tranfered in pages of fixed size.
   The page is represented by Page class.
   Each page has its uniq identyfier represented by PageId type.

3. Buffer manager
   Buffer magager (implemented in class BufferMgr) is responsible for:
     a) tranfering data from disk into memory,
     b) transfering data from memory to disk.
  Pages in the buffer manager are kept in frames (class Frame),
  where "dirty" bit and "pin-count" are stored.
